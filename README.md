# Joker Poker

## Project
Developed during an Advanced Object-Oriented Programming class, the base problem was heavily
inspired by this [Rosetta Code problem](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Poker_hand_analyser). In short,
this project is a Poker Hand Analyzer in which a hand can contain up to 2 Jokers which acts as a
wildcard to be transformed to any possible card, so a hand like this: __joker  2♦  2♠  k♠  q♦__ : would
be recognized as a three-of-a-kind.

## Solution
This solution was heavily inspired by another one of my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Woontopia/poker).
